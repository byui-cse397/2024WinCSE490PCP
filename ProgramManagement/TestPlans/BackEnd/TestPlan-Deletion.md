# Test Case #3 - Delete User Account
 
## Objective:
To verify that the backend system correctly deletes an existing user's account upon request.
 
## Preconditions:
1. Backend server is up and running correctly.
2. The user to be deleted exists in the system and is requesting deletion.
3. The user requesting deletion is authenticated and authorized to delete the account.
 
## Test Steps:
1. **Start with:** The authenticated user has requested account deletion.
2. **Actions:**
    a. Send a DELETE request to the backend API endpoint designated for account deletion.
    b. Include the user's unique identifier (userId or username) in the request.
    c. Ensure backend validates the requestor's permissions to perform account deletion.
    d. Backend processes the deletion request and removes the user's data from the database.
    e. Backend should revoke any active sessions or tokens associated with the user account.
    f. Backend sends a confirmation response to the client upon successful deletion.
3. **Ends with:** The user account is no longer present in the system.
 
## Expected Results:
- The backend returns a success response indicating the account has been deleted.
- The user's account or information is no longer retrievable from the database.
- The user cannot log in or recover the account post-deletion.
- Any subsequent API requests referencing the deleted user should be invalid.
 
## Postconditions:
- Verify that the user's data does not exist in any part of the system.
- Ensure that any personal data is purged in compliance with data protection regulations.
 
## Notes:
- Ensure that deletion is permanent and meets all regulatory compliance requirements.
- Test for potential cascading effects on related data, such as posts or comments made by the user. Ensure no cascading effects affect other users.
- Check for proper error handling and messaging when deletion is not possible (e.g., due to pending operations).
 
## Test Data:
- Use an account that is earmarked for deletion with no dependencies that would prevent its removal. The false account should have at least one post and comment to ensure thereâ€™s no cascading during the user deletion.
 
## Test Environment:
- A test environment that mimics the production environment but does not affect live user data.
- A backend environment that is configured for testing with mock data for deletion.
 
## References:
- API documentation for the account deletion endpoint.
- Backend logic implementation for the delete operation.
- Data retention and deletion policies.
 
Please ensure this test case aligns with your project's specifics and adjust any steps or expectations to match your actual implementation and business rules.

Additional Test Cases
## Unit Test Cases

- [ ] Unit Test Case 1: Delete Account API Endpoint
**Objective**: Test the `deleteAccount` API endpoint to ensure it correctly processes deletion requests.

**Input**:
- Valid user credentials and deletion request.

**Expected Output**:
- Successful deletion response, user data removed from database.

**Test Steps**:
1. Mock a valid user deletion request.
2. Invoke the `deleteAccount` endpoint with the mocked request.
3. Verify the response is successful.
4. Check the database to ensure the user's data is removed.

## Unit Test Case 2: Authentication Verification for Deletion
**Objective**: Verify that the deletion process checks for user authentication.

**Input**:
- Deletion request with invalid or no authentication token.

**Expected Output**:
- Authentication error, account remains intact.

**Test Steps**:
1. Mock a deletion request without an authentication token.
2. Invoke the `deleteAccount` endpoint.
3. Expect an authentication error.
4. Verify that the user's account is still present in the database.

---

## Unit Test Case 3: User Confirmation for Account Deletion
**Objective**: Ensure that the system requires user confirmation before deletion.

**Input**:
- Deletion request without user confirmation.

**Expected Output**:
- Account deletion is aborted, account remains intact.

**Test Steps**:
1. Mock a deletion request that bypasses user confirmation.
2. Invoke the `deleteAccount` endpoint.
3. Verify that the system aborts the deletion.
4. Confirm the user's account still exists in the database.

## Unit Test Case 4: Data Privacy Compliance on Deletion
**Objective**: Confirm that all user-related data is removed upon account deletion.

**Input**:
- Valid deletion request with user confirmation.

**Expected Output**:
- All user-related data is purged from the system.

**Test Steps**:
1. Mock a valid deletion request with user confirmation.
2. Invoke the `deleteAccount` endpoint.
3. Verify the response indicates a successful deletion.
4. Check all databases and storage to confirm all user data is purged.

---

## Unit Test Case 5: Error Handling in Account Deletion
**Objective**: Test the system's ability to handle errors during the deletion process.

**Input**:
- Deletion request that triggers a known error (e.g., database timeout).

**Expected Output**:
- Deletion process is halted, informative error message is returned.

**Test Steps**:
1. Mock a deletion request that will cause a database timeout.
2. Invoke the `deleteAccount` endpoint.
3. Verify that the deletion process is halted.
4. Check for an informative error message in the response.

## Unit Test Case 6: Account Deactivation Option
**Objective**: Test the optional account deactivation feature.

**Input**:
- Request for account deactivation.

**Expected Output**:
- Account is deactivated, not deleted, and can be reactivated.

**Test Steps**:
Mock a request for account deactivation.
Invoke the relevant endpoint for account deactivation.
Verify the account is deactivated but not deleted.
Confirm that reactivation is possible.

## Unit Test Case 7: Logging Account Deletion Requests
Objective: Ensure that deletion requests are properly logged for auditing.

Input:

Valid deletion request.
Expected Output:

Deletion request is logged with sufficient details.
Test Steps:

Mock a valid deletion request.
Invoke the deleteAccount endpoint.
Verify that the request, along with details like timestamp and user ID, is logged.
Unit Test Case 8 Data Download Before Deletion
Objective: Test the functionality that allows users to download their data before deletion.

Input:

Request for data download prior to account deletion.
Expected Output:

Data is packaged and made available for download.
Test Steps:

Mock a request for user data download.
Invoke the data download functionality.
Verify that the user's data is correctly packaged for download.
