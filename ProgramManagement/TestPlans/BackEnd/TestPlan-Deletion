**Test Case #3 - Delete User Account**

**Objective:**

To verify that the backend system correctly deletes an existing user's account upon request.

**Preconditions:**

1. Backend server is up and running correctly.
2. The user to be deleted exists in the system and is requesting deletion.
3. The user requesting deletion is authenticated and authorized to delete the account.

**Test Steps:**

1. Start with: The authenticated user has requested account deletion.
2. Actions: a. Send a DELETE request to the backend API endpoint designated for account deletion. b. Include the user's unique identifier (userId or username) in the request. c. Ensure backend validates the requestor's permissions to perform account deletion. d. Backend processes the deletion request and removes the user's data from the database. e. Backend should revoke any active sessions or tokens associated with the user account. f. Backend sends a confirmation response to the client upon successful deletion.
3. Ends with: The user account is no longer present in the system.

**Expected Results:**

- The backend returns a success response indicating the account has been deleted.
- The user's account or information is no longer retrievable from the database.
- The user cannot log in or recover the account post-deletion.
- Any subsequent API requests referencing the deleted user should be invalid.

**Postconditions:**

- Verify that the user's data does not exist in any part of the system.
- Ensure that any personal data is purged in compliance with data protection regulations.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that deletion is permanent and meets all regulatory compliance requirements.
- Test for potential cascading effects on related data, such as posts or comments made by the user. Ensure no cascading effects affect other users.
- Check for proper error handling and messaging when deletion is not possible (e.g., due to pending operations).

**Test Data:**

- Use an account that is earmarked for deletion with no dependencies that would prevent its removal. The false account should have at least one post and comment to ensure thereâ€™s no cascading during the user deletion.

**Test Environment:**

- A test environment that mimics the production environment but does not affect live user data.
- A backend environment that is configured for testing with mock data for deletion.

**References:**

- API documentation for the account deletion endpoint.
- Backend logic implementation for the delete operation.
- Data retention and deletion policies.

Please ensure this test case aligns with your project's specifics and adjust any steps or expectations to match your actual implementation and business rules.
