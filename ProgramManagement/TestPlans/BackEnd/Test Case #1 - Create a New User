**Objective:**

To verify that the backend functionality successfully creates a new user with valid data.  

**Preconditions:**

1. Backend server is running and accessible. 

2. User Management form is displayed and accessible to the user.  

**Test Steps:**

1. Starts with: User Management form is displayed to the user.  

2. Actions: 

   a. Change the view properties to input valid user data including: 

      - Username 

      - Email address 

      - Password 

      - Other optional user details (if applicable) 

   b. Raise the `SaveUser` event by submitting the form or clicking on the "Register" button. 

   c. Monitor the communication between the frontend and backend to ensure that the correct API endpoint for user registration is invoked. 

   d. Ensure that the backend receives the user registration request with the provided data. 

   e. The backend validates the received data for correctness and completeness. 

   f. The backend processes the registration request and saves the new user data in the database. 

   g. The backend triggers necessary actions such as sending a verification email, if applicable.  

3. Ends with: New user is successfully created in the backend.  

**Expected Results:**

- The backend responds with a success message indicating that the user registration was successful. 

- The newly registered user data is correctly stored in the database. 

- The backend returns an appropriate response to the frontend indicating the success of the registration process.  

**Postconditions:**

- The new user should be able to log in using the registered credentials. 

- The user's data should be accessible and correctly displayed in the application. 

**Notes:**

- Perform backend validation to ensure that the provided data meets the required format and constraints. 

- Test edge cases such as special characters, maximum length limits, and boundary values for fields. 

- Ensure that the backend handles errors gracefully and provides informative error messages in case of failures. 

- Monitor backend logs to track the registration process and identify any potential issues. 

- Coordinate with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend components.  

**Test Data:**

- Valid user data including a unique username, valid email address, and strong password. 

- Invalid user data to test error handling and validation messages.  

**Test Environment:**

- Backend environment configured for testing purposes. 

- Test database with isolated data for user registration testing.

- User registration API documentation. 

- Backend codebase for user registration logic. 

- Frontend UI design and implementation for user registration form.
