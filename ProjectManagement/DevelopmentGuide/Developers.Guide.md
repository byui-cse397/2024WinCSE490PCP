**Part 1: Planning**

**Development Environments**

As a team we brainstormed and studied various development environments for our program. At the end of our session, we came to the conclusion to program in Python, as it’s the easiest to pick up and learn out of all the languages.

-Update: Brother Clements recommended we create our program within Android Studios.

**Community Board Features**

As a team, we decided upon several characteristics we wanted our Community Board program to have. Some of those features included:

- <a name="_int_b4nqsmno"></a>Accounts for each individual accessing the board.
- The ability for individuals to post and comment on others’ posts on the board.
- Reviews tied into posts and comments within the board.
- A search/category option so individuals may search for specific posts/accounts on the board.
- A calendar for individuals to keep track of rides, payments, interviews, requests, and both commercial and personal events.
- Private/group messaging platforms for individuals to communicate over.

We also discussed the difficulty and complexity in implementing each feature of our program. Lower numbers mean simpler and higher numbers mean more complex.

- Accounts: 8
- Posts/Comments: 8
- Reviews to Posts/Comments: 12
- Search/Category: 12
- Calendar: 16
- Messaging Platforms: 16
