Introduction   

For our project we are making a mobile app that can help people find jobs or post jobs. To do this we will need to know what audience we are aiming for and what tools we will need to do the job this. After going over both of these topics our team has come to the conclusion that the best tool for our front-end work for this project is android studio. 

 

Android studio 

What does android studio offer? Android studio is a IDE that gives you all the tools that you could need to create a mobile app. It gives access to an Android emulator allowing you to create the view of the app you are aiming for along with the ability to test your program on a device, so you know when your tasks are ready to ship. 

 

Android studio allows the code from Kolten and Java, two programing languages that if we don't already know we can learn very fast because of their simplicity. We can still use other languages for the back-end but for the front-end view these are the languages that Android studio supports.  

 

Android studio also gives us the ability to get our app posted onto the android store. https://developer.android.com/studio/publish at the moment our team does not plan on releasing this app onto IOS but if we were we would need to create the app using a different IDE. 

 

AWS Amplify 

Another option that we have AWS Amplify  

AWS provides scalable infrastructure services that can grow with the demands of your Android app. Whether your user base grows rapidly or experiences fluctuations in usage, AWS can automatically scale resources to accommodate varying workloads. 

As of my last update in January 2022, Amazon Web Services (AWS) did not offer its own Android emulator specifically tailored for Android app development. However, AWS does provide various services and resources that developers can leverage to build, test, and deploy Android apps. 

Vs code 

Vs code is an option for us to use for this project because it gives us access to a IDE but it does not give us the ability to an emulator for an android or ios phone we would need to install Genny motion Emulator, and this is more work than it's worth just to be able to us VS code. We would also need to figure out how to install the right packages needed to get VS to even work with android devices and these tools come out of the box with the other options. 

 

Final 

Because Android studio is the only IDE we can use that also offers a reliable and strong emulator right out of the box this is the best option for what we are working on. This will allow us to make our app and tie it to our git Hub very easy and hopefully run into the least amount of problems
