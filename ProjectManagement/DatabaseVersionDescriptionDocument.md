## Week 8
In this version of our application, we mostly worked on adding various test cases. 
We also made a draft of our db initializer file, and started attempting to add things to the DB a little bit. 

## Week 10
In this version, we completed test cases. We also improved upon the DB initializer file, and we started working on automating a java file, but it is proving to be difficult. 

## Week 12
In this version, I realized we didn't complete the test cases yet. I created tests for adding to each table in the database. I also added some useful scripts at the bottom of the init.sql file.
