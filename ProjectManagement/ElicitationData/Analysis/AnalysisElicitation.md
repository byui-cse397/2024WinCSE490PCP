Title: Software Requirements Specification

**Analysis Technique Summary:**
The analysis of potential scenarios, SWOT analysis, and a prioritized list of features provide comprehensive insights for the university community board app. Non-functional requirements emphasize the importance of security, reliability, availability, usability, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Constraints include security, accessibility, and cultural/language considerations.
The SWOT analysis identifies strengths like a niche market and integration with school systems, weaknesses such as team experience and short development periods, opportunities like alumni engagement and community building, and threats related to security, moderation, and legal requirements. Understanding these factors is crucial for effective project management.
The prioritized list of features emphasizes core functionalities based on survey responses and introspective considerations. Key features include sign-in functionality, a robust moderation system, security measures, easy creation of forum categories, and location-specific communities. Private messaging, a marketplace, and filtering/sorting options also make the priority list.


**Conclusion:**
Considering the analysis techniques employed, the university community board app should focus on the following key requirements:


1. *Security and Privacy Measures:*
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Ensure data encryption, secure password policies, and firewall protection.
- Include clear disclosure mechanisms to comply with legal requirements and maintain user trust.

2. *Reliability and Availability:*
- Establish a reliable data backup and recovery system.
- Aim for a high level of availability (e.g., 99.9%) with redundancy measures.
- Plan for non-disruptive maintenance hours to ensure continuous access.

3. *Usability and Scalability:*
- Design an intuitive user interface with customizable notifications.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for optimal user experience on various devices.
- Incorporate localization features to address cultural and language constraints.

In conclusion, prioritizing security, reliability, usability, and scalability will lay the foundation for a robust university community board app. These requirements align with user expectations, regulatory standards, and the unique characteristics of the app's development environment, ensuring a successful and user-centric platform.
