Integration level
We plan to finish up our side of codeine with allowing back into be updated,
who's doing this will allow for us to be able to test that each hyperlink to each
code repository goes well with one another.

Regression level
We need to ask ourselves the following questions.
Is the user's input being sent over
Is there something incorrect in the users form that needs to be corrected
Does the information that the user is requesting be pulled up in the spots where it's shown.

System-level
We want to make sure that each Java page allows for the users to be able to correctly
implement their username, password, emails, and other materials in to the beta base,
and then be pulled from the database to be shown in the front end.

Acceptance level
We wish for that information that is stored in the database to be shown for the users 
and to be allowed for the users to see where their information is being stored.
